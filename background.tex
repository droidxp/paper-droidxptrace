In this section, we introduce the concepts and terminology that are necessary to understand the remainder of this paper. First, Section~\ref{sec:sand} introduces some background information about \emph{sandboxes} at security context. Section~\ref{sec:repackage} presents background about repackage apps, and how they works at Android environment.
After that, in Section~\ref{sec:android-sandbox} we review the mine sandbox approach for repackage detection in Android apps. Section~\ref{sec:cg} presents some background information about call graphs, and in the end, Section~\ref{sec:mf} presents some
information about Android Manifest file.
