\section{Results}\label{sec:results}


In this section, we detail the findings of our study.  We remind the reader that our main goal with this study is to
better understand the strengths and limitations of the \mas for malware detection using the state-of-the-art
test case generation tool (DroidBot). We explore
the results of our research using two datasets: the \sds (\appsSmall app pairs), and \cds (\apps pairs).


\subsection{Exploratory Data Analysis of Accuracy}\label{sec:accuracy}


{\bf \sds.} Considering the \sds (102 apps), the \mas for malware detection 
classifies a total of 69 repackaged versions as malware (67.64\%).
This result is close to what Bao et al. reported~\cite{DBLP:conf/wcre/BaoLL18}.
That is, in their original paper,  the \mas using DroidBot classifies 66.66\% of the
repackaged version of the apps as malware~\cite{DBLP:conf/wcre/BaoLL18}.
This result confirms that we were able to reproduce the findings of the original study using our
implementation of the \mas. 

\tb{1}{We were able to reproduce the results of
  existing research using our implementation of the \mas,
  achieving a malware classification in the
  \sds close to what has been reported in
  previous studies.}

In the previous studies~\cite{DBLP:conf/wcre/BaoLL18,DBLP:journals/jss/CostaMMSSBNR22},
the authors assume that all repackaged versions contain a
malicious behavior. For this reason, the authors do not
explore accuracy metrics (such as Precision, Recall, and
F-measure ($F_1$))---all repackaged apps labeled as
malware are considered true positives in the previous studies.
As we mentioned, in this paper we take advantage
of \vt to label our dataset and build a ground truth:
In our datasets, we classify a repackaged version of an app as malware if, according to our \vt
query results, at least two security engines identify malicious behavior in the asset.
This decision aligns with existing recommendations~\cite{vt-label,DBLP:journals/ese/KhanmohammadiEH19}).
%\kn{Now its a bit clearer, but I would expect a separate paragraph when we introduce VT explaing how VT serves as a better ground truth and also justify our choices on the numbers with VT a bit more -- why we have two as the magic number of antivirus scanners... }
The first row of Table~\ref{tab:accuracy} shows that the \mas achieves an accuracy of 0.89 when
considering the \sds. Nonetheless, the \mas fails
to correctly classify seven assets as malware on the \sds (FN column, first row of Table~\ref{tab:accuracy}),
and wrongly labeled the repackaged version of seven apps as malware (FP column).

    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  }
  \label{tab:accuracy}
\end{table*}

%We also investigate if one could improve the performance of the \mas using an enriched comparison approach. That is, instead of only comparing the sets of calls to sensitive APIs, here we also compare the traces from entry points to such a calls. If there is at least one trace that appears only during the execution of the test cases in the repackaged version of the app, we label that version as a malware.


%Introducing trace analysis reduces the number of false negatives to two, with the side effect of increasing the number of false positives from 7 to 18 (see the second row of Table~\ref{tab:accuracy}). In general, the accuracy ($F_1$) of the \mas using trace analysis drops from 0.89 to 0.87.


%\tb{2}{Although the use of Trace Analysis reduces the number of false negatives (in comparison with the vanilla \mas), it slightly decreases the overall accuracy ($F_1$) of the \mas to detect malware, from 0.89\% to 0.87\% in the \sds.} 


{\bf \cds.} Surprisingly, considering our complete dataset (\apps apps), the \mas
labels a total of \review{$1,395$} repackaged apps as malware (\review{$34.22$\%} of the total number of repackaged
apps)---for which the repackaged version calls at least one additional sensitive API.
Our analysis also reveals a {\bf negative result} related to the accuracy of the approach: here,
the accuracy is much lower in comparison to what we reported for the
\sds (see the second row of Table~\ref{tab:accuracy}): $F_1$ dropping from \fscoreSmall to \fscore.
This result indicates that, when considering a large dataset, the accuracy of the \mas using
DroidBot drops significantly.


%The use of the trace analysis reduces the number of false negatives in the \cds (from 286 to 245), though increasing the number of false positives from 173 to 326. Altogether, the $F_1$ measure does not change when comparing performance of the vanilla \mas and its trace-based variant in the \cds. 


\tb{2}{
  The \mas for malware detection
  leads to a substantially lower performance on the
  \cds (\apps pairs of apps),
  dropping the \fone from 0.89 to \fscore in comparison to
  what we observed in the \sds.}


Therefore, the resulting sandbox we generate using
DroidBot suffers from a significantly low accuracy rate when considering a large dataset.
%Besides that, enriching the \mas with trace analysis does not  improve the overall accuracy in the \cds (even though we reduce the number of false negatives with trace analysis, the increasing in the number of false positives negatively impacts the performance of the approach). 
This is shown in the second row of Table~\ref{tab:accuracy}.
The negative performance of the \mas in the \cds encouraged us to endorse efforts aimed at identifying potential reasons for
this phenomenon and motivate the research questions RQ2 and RQ3.

\subsection{Assessment Based on \sscore}

Figure~\ref{fig:ss} shows the \sscore distribution
over the two datasets we use in our research
(the \sds and the \cds).
Recall that the \sscore measures how similar the
original and repackaged versions of an app are.
The SmallDS exhibits an average \sscore of 0.89 (with a median of 0.99 and standard deviation of 0.25),
whereas the complete dataset averages a \sscore of 0.90 (with a median of 0.98 and standard deviation of 0.18). 

The average \sscore of the
\sds is 0.89 (median of 0.99 and sd of 0.25); while
the average \sscore of the complete dataset is
\review{0.90} (median of \review{0.98} and sd of \review{0.18}).

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{images/boxplotSimilarity_V2.pdf}
  \caption{\sscore of the malware samples in the small and complete datasets. The boxplots in the figure do not show
  outliers.}
  \label{fig:ss}
\end{figure}
% \fh{at table 1 I inserted at second columns the sample amount}

In this section we investigate how the \sscore influences the accuracy of the \mas. We employ
Logistic Regression to quantify the relationship between them. For this analysis, instances of true
negatives (i.e., cases where the repackaged version is benign according to \vt and the \mas
correctly labels it as benign) are excluded.
As such, we test the following null hypothesis:

\begin{quote}
  {\bf $H_0$} \sscore does not influence the accuracy of the
  \mas for malware detection. 
\end{quote}

The results of the logistic regression suggest that we should reject our null hypothesis ($p$-value $=$ $2.22\cdot10^{-16}$).
This finding indicates that the accuracy of the \mas is influenced by the similarity between the original and repackaged versions
of an app.


%This finding suggests that the \mas is more likely to assign a correct label to a repackaged app in the cases where its \sscore with the original app is small. %This is an expected result, since we found a higher accuracy on the \sds, even though  the \sscore of the original and repackage apps in both datasets do not differ significantly.

%\kn{I am a bit confused here. Higher similariy score implies the app pairs are close to each other, making the detection easier? Or maybe I misundertood it here.}

\tb{3}{There is an association between
  the \sscore and the \mas performance, which means that
  the similarity between the original and repackaged versions of
  an app can explain the performance
  of the \mas for malware classification.}


To clarify the lack of association between
\sscore and correctness, we use the \emph{K-Means} algorithm to split the
\cds into ten clusters---according to the \sscore. We then
estimate the percentage of correct classifications for each cluster, as
we show in Table~\ref{tab:ss-clusters}. Note that the \mas
achieves the highest percentage of correct classification (70.40\%) for the third cluster (cId = 3), which
presents an average \sscore of (0.67). Nonetheless, the
cluster cId = 10, with larger number of samples (1248) and \sscore (0.99), presents a percentage of correct classifications of 26.68\%. We can observe that as the average similarity rate decreases, there is a tendency toward greater accuracy in the \mas. Hence, the low average similarity score could explain the poor performance of the \mas on the \cds, especially considering that most samples exhibit a high average similarity of 0.99.

\begin{table}[ht]

    pattern associating the percentage of
    correct answers with the \sscore.

\subsection{Assessment Based on Malware Family}
%\fh{inserted a little introduction about malware family}


%\kn{I feel we need some definition of what we mean by a family of malware. Words like gappusin etc donot have big meaning for people outside this domain}
As we discussed in the previous
section, the similarity assessment can explain the low performance of the
\mas on the \cds. Since the \cds covers a wide range of malware families, we investigate the
hypothesis that the malware families in the \cds also could
explain the poor performance of the \mas on the \cds.
Indeed, in the \cds, we identified a total of
\review{116 malware families}, though the most frequent
ones are \gps (\appsGps samples), \fm{revmob} (207 samples), \fm{dowgin} (183 samples) and \emph{airpush} (120 samples). Together, they
account for \review{$67.68$\%} of the repackaged apps in our \cds labeled as malware according to \vt.

This family distribution in the \cds is
different from the family
distribution in the \sds---where the
families \fm{kuguo} (34 samples), \fm{dowgin} (12 samples),
and \fm{youmi} (5 samples) account for
73.91\% of the families considering the 69
repackaged apps \vt labels as malware in the \sds.
Most important, in the \sds, there is just one
sample from the \gps family. This observation
leads us to the question: \emph{how does the \mas
perform when considering only the gappusin samples?}



The confusion matrix of Table~\ref{tab:gappusin} summarizes the accuracy assessment of the \mas considering
only the \gps samples in the \cds. Note that \vt classifies as malware all repackaged versions in the \gps
family and that for \appsGpsFN samples \review{($87.50$\%)}, the \mas was not able to correctly identify
a repackaged version of an app as a malware (recall of \review{0.1}). 
%Merging the outcomes of both approaches (that is, the vanilla \mas and
%the \mas with traces), leads to a recall of
%$\frac{27}{198} = 0.13$. 
Further, if we remove the \gps
samples from the \cds, the recall
of the \mas increases to \review{0.70} (\review{still small when compared with the original studies}). 

\begin{table}[ht]
  \caption{Confusion matrix of the \mas when considering only the
  samples from the \gps family in the \cds.}

\begin{tabular}{r|cc} \hline
\multirow{2}{*}{Actual Condition}   & \multicolumn{2}{c}{Predicted Condition} \\ 
                                    & Benign    & Malware   \\ \hline 
  Benign  (0)                       & TN (0)    & FP (0)    \\

\end{tabular}
\label{tab:gappusin}
\end{table}


\tb{4}{The \mas fails to correctly
  identify \review{$87.50$\%} of the samples from the \gps family
  as a malware. This is the main reason for the low
  recall of the \mas in the \cds.}


We further analyze the samples from \gps malware family in our dataset, given its
relevance to the negative result we present in our paper. First,
Figure~\ref{fig:hist-gappusin} shows a histogram of the \sscore for the samples
in the \gps family. Note that most of the repackaged versions from the
\gps family are quite similar to the original versions (average \sscore
of 0.94, median \sscore of 0.99, and sd of 0.16). We also reengineer
a sample of 30 \gps malware, using the \texttt{SimiDroid}\footnote{https://github.com/lilicoding/SimiDroid},
\texttt{apktool}~\footnote{https://ibotpeaches.github.io/Apktool/},
and \texttt{smali2java}~\footnote{https://github.com/AlexeySoshin/smali2java} tools.
Considering this sample of 30 \gps malware, the median \sscore is 0.99. In addition,
the repackaged version of the apps changes 4.96 methods (on average). Table~\ref{tab:simidroid-outputs} summarizes
the outputs of \texttt{SimiDroid} for this sample of \gps apps.

The similarity assessment of this sample of 30 \gps malware reveals a few modification patterns when comparing the original and the
repackaged versions of the apps. First, no instance in this \gps sample dataset
modifies the Android Manifest file to require additional permissions, for instance.
In most of the cases, the repackaged version just changes the Manifest file to modify either
the package name or the main activity name. Moreover, 29 out of the 30 samples in this dataset  {\bf modifies} the 
method \texttt{void onReceive(Context,Intent)} of the class \texttt{com.games.AdReciver}. Although the results of the
decompilation process are difficult to understand in full (due to code obfuscation),
the goal of this modification is to change the behaviour of the benign version, so that it can
download a different version of the \texttt{data.apk} 
asset. Figure~\ref{code:onReceive} shows
the code pattern of the \texttt{onReceive} method presents in the samples. This modification
typically uses a new method (\texttt{public void a(Context)})
the repackaged versions often introduce into the same class (\texttt{AdReciver}).
Since there is no extra call to sensitive APIs, the \mas fails to label
the \gps samples correctly.

  }
}
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{Method introduced in 29 out of 30 \gps malware we randomly selected from the \cds.}
\label{code:onReceive}
\end{figure*}

Our assessment also reveals recurrent modification patterns that {\bf delete} methods in the
repackaged version of the apps. For instance, 20 repackaged apps in our
\gps sample of 30 malware remove the method \texttt{void b(Context)} from the
class \texttt{com.game.a}. This class extensively use 
the Android reflection API. Although it is not clear the real purpose of removing these methods,
that decision simplifies the procedure of downloading a \texttt{data.apk} asset that is different
from the asset available in the original version of the apps. Removing those methods might
also be an strategy for antivirus evasion. For instance, although
some usages of the class \texttt{DexClassLoader} might be legitimate, it allows specific
types of atack based on dynamic code injection~\cite{falsina:acsac}. As such, 
antivirus might flag specific patterns using the Android reflection API suspect. 
Unfortunately, the \mas also fails to identify
a malicious behavior with this type of change (i.e., changes that remove methods).
Listing~\ref{code:deletedMethod} shows an example of code pattern frequently removed
from the repackaged versions from the \gps family.

In summary, our reverse engineering effort brings evidence that malware samples from the \gps family neither modify the Android Manifest files nor call additional sensitive APIs. It acts as a
downloader for further malicious app~\cite{DBLP:conf/ndss/ArpSHGR14}---which reduce the ability of the \mas to correctly classify a sample as a malware. Both versions (original/repackaged) from the \gps family have the same behavior for showing advertisements to the user,
however the repackaged version have additional call sites to the advertisement API and the advertisements sources are different. This behavior is not so harmful when compared to others repackaged apps, however nothing prevents that others malware families insert malicious operations, such as theft of
sensitive data.

%%\alert{We argue in favor of new research efforts to integrate the \mas 
%%with other techniques that could increase their performance
%%on malware identification. Since the samples from the \gps
%%family use specific patterns to introduce malicious behavior,
%%it might be promising to explore complementary techniques that
%%search for these patterns.}

%% Our exploration of all sensitive APIs called by all app pairs brought to the light the most frequently abused sensitive APIs that
%% appear in the repackaged, malicious version of the apps. We observed that when executed all 800 app pairs, DroidBot called $75$ sensitive APIs at least one time (from our list of 162 sensitive APIs). Among them, $16$ APIs account for more than half of all calls ($51.06$\%).
%% %\rb{I could not understand the previous sentence}.
%% The sensitive API that is abused the most by repackaged apps is \textbf{android.telephony.TelephonyManager: java.lang.String getDeviceId()}, which gets the device
%% IMEI\footnote{From Wikipedia: International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) is a number, usually unique, to identify 3GPP and iDEN mobile phones.}.
%% Table~\ref{tab:APIused} presents the list of the most frequent sensitive APIs that only the malicious
%% version of the apps in our dataset call.

%% \begin{obs}{6}{}
%%   The results so far bring evidence that only a handful of resources accesses like the \textbf{device id} are most attractive to malware designers, providing a potentially high-impact point of focus for future researchers and practitioners.

%% \begin{obs}{1}{}
%%    %\kn{Here we need to add some final take aways of the reproduction study}
%%    Our results indicate that in the presence of a representative dataset ($800$ app pairs as opposed to $102$ and a diverse similarity index), the accuracy of state of the art in mining sandbox approaches, using DroidBot drops significantly (from $63.36\%$ to $24.12\%$). Our results also indicate that only few sensitive APIs are responsible for majority of injected malware in repackaged apps. This encourages the emergence of new proposals that can support mine sandbox mitigating \textit{blindspot}s that lead to low accuracy.
%%  \end{obs}


%\kn{In this subsection, are we simply reproducing the results of existing papers. Because as far as I understand, tools like DroidBOT etc. were evaluated by simply comparing the sensitive APIs call. I am guessing here our contribution is to evaluate it on the larger dataset. I have given it a shot, please keep me posted if this is correct.}

%% \subsection{Trace Analysis Results}\label{sec:traceResults}

%% In this section, we describe the results of our investigation on how the trace from the entry point to sensitive API could impact the accuracy of sandbox approaches. Initially, we collect the call graphs of DroidBot execution using \emph{Logcat} and filter in the traces between the app's entry point and calls to any sensitive methods.

%% Then, using the callgraph from executions of both app versions (benign/malicious), we track the differences between their traces. We choose to investigate only app pairs that covered the same set of sensitive APIs detected in both versions during our first experiment (Section~\ref{sec:Sensitive APIs}). 


%% \begin{obs}{2}{}
%%  The state of the art in mining sandbox approaches using DroidBot have a blind-spot when it comes to being aware of the trace taken from the entry point to a sensitive API call. The approaches could have a improvement of $22\%$ if it considered trace as a factor. Similar  improvements are also seen with the original dataset of $101$ app pairs (improvement of $18.81\%$).
%%  \end{obs}

%% \subsection{Manifest File Analysis}\label{sec:manifestResults}

%% In this section, we describe the results of our investigation on the impact of modified manifest files on the accuracy of sandbox approaches. 
%% To this end, we check some particulars from manifest file, that point to a likely suspicious behavior. In section \ref{sec:manifestAnalysis}, we illustrated that an automatic hacking script could inject permission requests at manifest file regardless of whether this request is already present on it, which can result in duplicated permission and actions in the Manifest file. We looked out for such modifications in the malware that went undetected by the test generation tools. Table~\ref{tab:mfa} summarizes our results.


%% The column (SAPI) indicates the number of malware that went undetected during our first study (same as Table~\ref{tab:pa}'s Same API set (SAPI)). The second column (DP) indicates how many Manifest files from malicious app undetected at first study, had duplicated permission. Same way, column (DA) denotes the number of Manifest files with the duplicated actions in their manifest file.

%% A duplicate request for permission or action in a malicious version's manifest file should have been performed by a script. A simple analysis of manifest file could detect $120$ of undetectable malware from the first experiment ($607$), if it considers explorer duplicate permissions or actions at manifest file code as a detection strategy. If we combine the previous trace analysis with manifest file analysis, we improve the accuracy rate to $55.75\%$.

%% It is to be noted that in the presence of the original dataset of $101$ app pairs, the manifest file analysis combined with the trace analysis earlier discussed improves the accuracy rate to $90.09\%$ confirming that such an analysis, even though naive and simple does have an impact on the accuracy rate of mining sandbox approaches.  %\kn{Handrick as before please put the full numbers in the table}


%% \begin{obs}{3}{}
%%  We can conclude that sandbox approach also could have better accuracy if they considered the suspicious modifications in manifest file in their analysis. Although the analysis required of the manifest file is quite naive, we believe the results present an interesting and relevant insight for developers of malware detection tools to improve accuracy.
