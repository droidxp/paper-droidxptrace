\section{Conclusions and future work}\label{sec:conclusions}

The Mining Android Sandboxes (MAS) approach~\cite{DBLP:conf/icse/JamrozikZ16} has been tailored for Android malware detection~\cite{DBLP:conf/wcre/BaoLL18}
and empirically validated in a couple of studies~\cite{DBLP:conf/wcre/BaoLL18,DBLP:conf/iceccs/LeB0GL18,DBLP:journals/jss/CostaMMSSBNR22}.
To better understand the strengths and limitations of the \mas for malware detection,
in this paper we reported the results of an empirical study that reproduces previous research
work~\cite{DBLP:conf/wcre/BaoLL18,DBLP:journals/jss/CostaMMSSBNR22} using a larger and more
diverse dataset---which comprises \apps pairs of \emph{original} and \emph{repackaged} apps.
To our surprise, the performance of the \mas drops significantly in this new dataset, in particular
because the \mas fails to detect a specific family of Android malware (named \gps). 

We also explored a specific extension to the \mas that compares call graphs starting from
the \emph{entry points} of the programs to the places where the calls to sensitive APIs occur. Although
this extension reduces the number of false negatives of the \emph{vanilla \mas}, it was not
sufficient to increase the \mas accuracy in the large dataset. These negative results
brought evidence of the need to complement \mas with other techniques, so that it could be
truly effective in the task of Android malware detection.
